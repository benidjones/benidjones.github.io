As one of PMC’s Directors of Administration for two years, I am in charge of conference logistics running up to and day-of the event. For 2020, I (along with my fellow DAs) were able to successfully plan and execute Princeton Model Congress 2020 virtually using the Attendify platform.\r\nRehack\r\n\r\nThe first-ever reverse hackathon, emphasizing a beginner-friendly approach where competitors redesign and implement existing tech in a more meaningful, socially responsible way. For Rehack’s virtual hackathons in 2020 and 2021, I led marketing to bring West Coast universities to Rehack for the first time. As a result, 9 West Coast Universities fielded at least one team to compete at Rehack for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
