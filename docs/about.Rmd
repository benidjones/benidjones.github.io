# Hello!
My name is John Kim, and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. My hobbies include traveling, 
watching eSports (#C9WIN), learning Japanese, and seeking out delicious new places to eat
throughout SoCal and the East Coast. I also love to sing, even though I'm not any good at it!
Feel free to ask me about my favorite restaurants and foodie moments!
