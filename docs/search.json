Serves as a companion web app for an in-development Alexa skill of the same name, allowing Austin Bcycle commuters to conveniently check their home station, plan their commute, and predict when bikes or docks will be available.\nInspired by my own experience as an Austin Bcycle commuter during the summer of 2021.\nPrinceton Room Draw 2021\nA simple web app published during Princeton’s annual dorm selection lottery, updated to reflect room changes and additional student populations during COVID-19. Original dorm listings published by Princeton Housing used an unorganized pdf of room listings; this web app simplified the process by allowing sorting by room type, square footage, and college affiliation, as well as allowing students to check their status in the lottery.\nWith the end of Room Draw in June, app is no longer in development; current deployment displays model rooms and removes student ID functionality to preserve privacy. Heroku deployment available here.\nKaggle Tabular Playground Series July 2021\nFor Kaggle’s Tabular Playground Series July 2021 machine learning competition, I wrote a full solution in R using tidy principles, including time series analysis, feature engineering, and modeling, that placed in the top 30% (at time of posting). The model was an ensemble between a hyperparameter-tuned boosted tree (XGBoost) and Random Forest (ranger) to predict carbon, benzene, and nitrogen oxide pollution based on weather sensor data.\nCode available here.\n\n\n\n",

I find that gaining health insurance was not associated with any increase in odds of illegal drug use at a statistically significant level (\\(p>0.1\\)), controlling for previous drug use, stress, income, race, sex, and age. Using an analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) test, I conclude that models with interaction terms do not explain more variation at a statistically significant level (\\(Chi>0.08\\)).\n\n\n\n",

There, I published privileged research and reports involving advertising technology and consumer data protection. To this end, I compiled, interpreted, and presented technical codebases, documentations, and expert statements/depositions on behalf of a lay audience of assistant attorneys general regarding ongoing confidential litigation in the tech industry. Specific issues I worked on include cryptography, protected categories in unsupervised clustering, privacy-utility optimization, and data protection in machine learning.\nAs a final project, I collaborated with 4 other interns from the Attorney General’s offices of Iowa and DC to present on US privacy standards to a nationwide coalition of Attorney General’s offices, with representatives from all 50 states.\nIssueVoter\nI previously worked at IssueVoter as a Business Development Intern, where I managed IssueVoter’s CRM platform on Airtable and helped launch its civic engagement workshop series. I also authored several bill summaries, direct pieces of content launched on the IssueVoter website.\nTeaching\nI am currently an Undergraduate Course Assistant for Princeton’s Department of Economics, where I TA for ECO310 - Microeconomic Theory: A Mathematical Approach under Professor Can Urgun. I am also an R Programming consultant for the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning.\nI was previously a course tutor for Princeton University courses through McGraw. I tutored for MAT175 - Mathematics for Economics/Life Sciences and POL345 - Introduction to Quantitative Social Science.\n\n\n\n",

Each semester, 6-8 other team members and I work with a nonprofit organization in pro bono consulting work, concluding with a project presentation to both the nonprofit and the entire PUNC club. See organizations I’ve worked with below.\nThe Citizens’ Campaign\nWe helped the Citizens’ Campaign release their civic engagement curriculum. This primarily consisted of designing and analyzing a survey to local community college professors regarding implementing the curriculum.\nAspire Coffeeworks\nWe helped Aspire Coffeeworks market their product to the Chicagoland area. This included a complete redesign of their branding, competitor analysis, pitching to local stores, and researching entryways into online markets.\nPrinceton Model Congress\n\nAmerica’s oldest model congress conference held in Washington DC. As one of PMC’s elected Directors of Administration for two years, I am in charge of conference logistics running up to and day-of the event. For 2020, I (along with my fellow DAs) were able to successfully plan and execute Princeton Model Congress 2020 virtually using the Attendify platform.\nRehack\n\nThe first-ever reverse hackathon, emphasizing a beginner-friendly approach where competitors redesign and implement existing tech in a more meaningful, socially responsible way. For Rehack’s virtual hackathons in 2020 and 2021, I led marketing to bring West Coast universities to Rehack for the first time. As a result, 9 West Coast universities fielded at least one team to compete at Rehack for the first time.\n\n\n\n",
