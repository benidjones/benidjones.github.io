# At a Glance
I am a student at Princeton University studying political economy and technology. I am particularly interested in quantitative and computational social science, with applications to machine learning, causal inference, and technology policy. I've most recently researched political disinformation on Twitter and antitrust law/policy in self-preferencing. 

I most recently served as a Technical Engagement Management Intern at Yext.
